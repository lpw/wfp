create database

populate users
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Lance');

populate pointtypes
INSERT INTO pointtypes (name) VALUES ('nav);

as needed
ALTER TABLE pointtypes AUTO_INCREMENT = 0;

and some aircraft too

Pres
keeping most everything self-contained for now (DDS separate repo for independence, vendor sw)


Microservices

UI for DB and aircraft
(html, css, js, static)
web: fleet, supervisor, routes, aircraft
http://gas (ground autonomy sandbox)
flow:
	aircraft is default page if nothing stored
	if stored, go to supervisor
	options for going to fleet, adding new aircraft 9even if stored)
	option to add new route on route selector buttons on fleet page
actions, reducers, selectors

API for DB
/apiv1 /fleet
actions, reducers, selectors

Database (server, wb schema)
SQL 
tables

WebDDS bridge from sim/aircraft to web UI (DDS reader, socket.io writer)

Checkpointer from sim/aircraft to DB (DDS reader, DB/SQL writer)
checkpoints into aircraft DB (DDS writer) (but DB is not source of truth, just a starting point if nothing else)

Watcher (DDS reader)
	monitors aircraft (pos, dir, speed, alt, systems, other aircraft, terrain, vertipots)
		listens to RTI DDS
	makes decisions about takes-offs, landings, flow control, conflicts (other aircraft and terrain), contigencies, ATC clearnces, weather, UTM, PSU, ground, etc
		when aircraft at origin airport close to flight time, launch - set aircraft speed, heading, alt from flight route, charge (aircraft), lat+lon of origin; set atd in flight DB
		when aircraft flying close to destination airport, land - set aircraft speed 0, alt to dest elev, charge, lat+lon (aircraft); set ata in flight DB
	controls aircraft by sending commands
		real: power, vectors, gear, systems, etc
		sim: speed, heading, alt, charge, lat/lon pos,?
	retains no data, not source of truth
Launcher
Lander
Flyer

sim has API to receive commands
/apiv1/n123 /speed, heading, alt, charge, lat+lon (also for pitch, roll, yaw from monile app); /accell
sim generates telemetry data to RTI DDS 
checkpoints into aircraft DB (DDS writer) in sep module
sim is source of truth

mobile/phone app to simulate/generate spatial info (pitch, roll, yaw, speed? alt?) from intertial sensors 
sends/posts commands directly to sim (source of truth)
